  - Done when: code paths strip emails for evidence and only store hashed/masked in other tables if needed.
- [x] robots.txt: Confirm crawler respects robots for all URLs. — Owner: BE — Status: Done — Updated: enforced in src/crawler.py (ROBOTS allowed checks)

**8) Agent Tasks (High-Level)**

- [~] E2E (fixtures): seed pages; assert cards and evidence counts; adopt flows update `icp_rules`. — Owner: QA — Status: In progress — Updated: tests/test_e2e_icp_flow.py simulates intake→suggest→accept with stubs
  - Done when: scenario passes in staging with realistic content.
- [~] Security/Role tests: viewer vs ops/admin enforcement on endpoints — Owner: QA/BE — Status: In progress — Updated: tests/test_icp_endpoints.py checks 401 enforcement on `/icp/suggestions`

**10) Rollout & Flags**

  - Done when: toggling disables/enables routes and UI surface.
- [ ] Pilot tenant: Enable flag for 1–2 tenants; monitor metrics and logs; iterate. — Owner: PM/BE — Status: Not started — Updated: -
  - Done when: acceptance criteria met for pilot; ready for broader rollout.
- [ ] Phases: track completion per phase — Owner: PM — Status: Not started — Updated: -
  - Phase 1: Migrations + endpoints + mapping + minimal crawl → suggestions.
  - Phase 2: Richer extraction, observability, UI polish, evidence drawer.
  - Phase 3: Tenant knobs; docs/runbooks; acceptance tests.
- [x] Runbooks: Operator guide to rerun mapping, inspect patterns, troubleshoot crawl blocks — Owner: BE/SRE — Status: Done — Updated: docs/runbook_icp_finder.md
  - Done when: docs added under `lead_generation-main/docs/` and referenced by README.

**11) Configuration**
- [~] Env vars: ENABLE_ICP_INTAKE, ICP_WIZARD_FAST_START_ONLY, CRAWLER_DOMAIN_MIN_INTERVAL_S, CHAT_ENRICH_LIMIT/RUN_NOW_LIMIT, ENRICH_BATCH_SIZE, SCHED_* — Owner: BE/DevOps — Status: In progress — Updated: documented in docs/runbook_icp_finder.md; consumed in code
  - Done when: documented in README/runbooks and consumed in code.

**12) Acceptance Criteria Checklist**
- [ ] ≥80% of provided seeds resolve to ACRA (domain or fuzzy) within 5 minutes of submission.
- [ ] UI presents ≥3 micro‑ICP suggestions (with evidence) when ≥5 seed customers provided.
- [ ] Negative ICP list shows ≥3 red‑flag themes derived from intake.
- [ ] `icp_patterns` refresh completes nightly and suggestions cite evidence items.
- [ ] Observability: metrics/logs for each stage present and actionable (dash or runbook samples)
 - [ ] Intake coverage: all fast‑start 10 + A–H questions present in conversational flow, validated/normalized, persisted in `answers_jsonb`.
- [ ] Targeting pack produced for adopted suggestions (SSIC + technographic filters + short pitch).

**Finder Flow Enhancements & Fixes (Implemented)**
- [x] Show industry names with SSIC codes in micro‑ICP suggestions and confirm previews (via `ssic_ref`).
- [x] Display accurate ACRA totals and sample rows using `_count_acra_by_ssic_codes` and `_select_acra_by_ssic_codes`.
- [x] Accept + Run flow in chat: `accept micro-icp N` then `run enrichment`.
- [x] Enrich 10 immediately (configurable) and queue the correct remainder for nightly.
- [x] Prevent auto‑run after server restart: boot‑guard + last‑speaker requirement in router.
- [x] Fix `icp_evidence.company_id NOT NULL`: ensure/insert `company_id` before evidence inserts.
- [x] Avoid routing loops/recursion: single decision per tick; explicit user action required for enrichment.

**13) Risks & Mitigations**
- Crawl 403s/aggregators: maintain blacklist; fallback to ACRA/public metadata; consider Playwright for JS-heavy sites.
- Fuzzy false positives: conservative threshold; evidence drawer for human review; log similarity scores.
- Cost control: enforce crawl caps; caching; vendor caps; stop conditions; daily caps per tenant.
- Data leakage: RLS or app-level isolation; redact; robots; audit logs on Accept.

**Runbook (Ops Quick Steps)**
- Apply migrations 001–004; verify tables and MV.
- Deploy service with `/icp` routes; set `ENABLE_ICP_INTAKE=true` for staging.
- Submit a sample intake; monitor logs for `mapping_sla` and evidence inserts.
- Verify `/icp/suggestions` shows 3–5 cards; accept one; confirm `icp_rules` updated.
- Confirm nightly scheduler refreshes MV and acceptance checks run.
